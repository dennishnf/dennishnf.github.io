Currently, I'm a research assistant at Bioinformatics and Molecular Biology Laboratory at Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia (UPCH), Peru. There, I develop Artificial Intelligence algorithms for early and low-cost medical diagnosis. I obtained my bachelor degree in Science with mention in Electronic Engineering from the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería (UNI), Peru, and ranked first in my graduating class. My research experience includes two research fellowships in Artificial Intelligence & Deep Learning at the AGH University of Science and Technology (Poland) and the University of Padova (Italy).
<br/>
<br/>
I have participated in in prestigious AI related conferences such as the ICML 2019 (USA), the NeurIPS 2019 (Canada), the ICML 2020 (Austria), the ACL 2020 (USA) and the RSS 2020 (USA). In the upcoming month, I will participate in top schools such as the 10th Lisbon Machine Learning School (LxMLS 2020) and the Cornell, Maryland, Max Planck Pre-doctoral Research School (CMMRS 2020). Also, my academic service experience includes participation as a committee member in the role of reviewer for LXAI Workshop at NeurIPS (2019) and LXAI Workshop at ICML (2020). In addition to my interest in AI, I have special interest in science fiction books, in discussions about technology and hacking culture.
